Once you get this code running, you need to add the following:

 

Create an image of your name using any sort of image creation program.  You¡¯ll display this in the upper left hand corner of screen as a texture.  Also, add your name to the window's titlebar.

 

The z^2 part of the equation can be modified for interesting effects.  Allow the user to press the keys 2 - 8 to change the exponent on the z term.

 

You should submit 7 screen shots showing your name texture and the Mandelbrot set for exponents 2-8.  Name your screen shots mandelx.jpg where x is the power of z to use.

 

For extra credit, taking this assignment to 200 total points, repeat this process for the Julia set.  Name these files juliax.jpg where x is the power of z used on each screen shot.  These should also contain the texture with your name on it in the upper left corner.
